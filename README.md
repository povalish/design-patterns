# Design Patterns

Repository was created while I was exploring (or learning) Design Pattern.

This repository contains three main folders as reference for three main pattern categories:

- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns

I try to code examples as closed as I can to frontend developer's tasks. All patterns were invented for OOP-like
languages, and some patterns have different 'look' on JavaScript.
